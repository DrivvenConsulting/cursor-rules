# Global Engineering Principles

## Purpose
Provide foundational principles that apply to all code, architecture, and decisions in this repository.

## Core Principles
- Write code for humans first, machines second
- Prefer simple and explicit solutions
- Follow the Zen of Python whenever applicable
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex

## Do
- Keep implementations straightforward
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Use meaningful names over comments

## Do Not
- Do not introduce unnecessary abstractions
- Do not add complexity without clear benefit
- Do not rely on comments to explain poor design
