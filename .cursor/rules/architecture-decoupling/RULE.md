# Architecture & Decoupling Rules

## Purpose
Prevent tight coupling and promote long-term maintainability.

## Principles
- Follow Clean Code, Clean Architecture, and Clean Coder principles
- Depend on abstractions, not implementations
- Favor contracts and interfaces

## Do
- Isolate concerns between layers
- Design components that can evolve independently
- Make dependencies explicit

## Do Not
- Do not couple systems directly
- Do not depend on concrete implementations across boundaries
